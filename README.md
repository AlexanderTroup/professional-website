# Goal

## Create a professional website

### What it do

  Place for people to come and find out about what I do 
  Place to filter and sort requests for work
  Somewhere that I don't have to keep rebuilding every so often for sharing my CV

### What it don't do
  
  Not a place to host original content(idea is to have that elsewhere and point to it here)
  Not a place to manage clients/requests
  ??Not a place for complex info that's not mobile friendly. 

### audience
3 audiences
  people looking to find my stream and social media accounts and Medium
  people looking to hire me(recruiters, companies, grannies)
  people looking to have me speak at an event

- Candidate pages
  - About Me
  - Portfolio/Work
  - Past Work
   - (possibly over-engineering)
   - CopyPaste my CV work
   - Tag roles by tech, stack, front/backend
   - Recent/Highlighted Tag
   - Important: list the dates for the projects. 
  - Contact Form
    - Company/Client Site
    - Message
  
## Make it WCAG compiant.

## Notes

public folder stays empty until a build is run.

## Next Steps

- Add Medium to links
- Investigate webpack tree shaking or bundle package analysis
- Introduce TypeScript(bonus)
- Add meta tags for sharing to various sites
  - Static tags in the header to begin with
  - Per-page tags for once we have separate pages(Home, contact)
